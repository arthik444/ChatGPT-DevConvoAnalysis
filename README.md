# Introduction
This repository contains datasets and analytical graphs from our research project focusing on interactions between software developers and ChatGPT. Our research aims to understand the dynamics of these interactions across three key dimensions: the utility of ChatGPT's code responses, consistency in responses to similar queries, and patterns in developers' prompts.

# Research Questions
- In how many instances is the code provided by ChatGPT in the first iteration perceived as beneficial or requiring corrections?
- Does providing identical or similar queries to different ChatGPT conversations yield the same results?
- Is it possible to recognize recurring patterns in the prompts that developers use when engaging with ChatGPT, and do these patterns demonstrate a connection with the effectiveness of resolving issues?
